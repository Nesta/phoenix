JS
--

For the moment you only have mytheme.js, you can add your code here.

Also, you can add your JS files into this directory.
Once you have your JS files you must choose one of the following steps, 
depending on your interests:

- DEFINING A LIBRARY:
  Define all of your asset libraries in mytheme.libraries.yml file in your 
  subtheme folder and make sure that it is declared in mytheme.info.yml file.

- OVERRIDING AND EXTENDING LIBRARIES:
  You must go to mytheme.info.yml to override libraries defined in 
  mytheme.libraries.yml. They can be either overridden or extended using 
  libraries-override or libraries-extend.

- ATTACHING LIBRARIES TO PAGES:
  Attaching a library via a Twig template:
  You can attach an asset library to a Twig template using the attach_library() 
  function in any *.html.twig, file like so:
  {{ attach_library('STARTERKIT/my-library') }}

  Attaching a library to all pages:
  To attach a library to all the pages that use your theme, declare it in your 
  theme's *.info.yml file, under the libraries.
  After editing the *.info.yml file, remember to clear the cache so that the 
  new information is loaded into Drupal.
